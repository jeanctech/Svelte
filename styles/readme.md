It was released in 2021 as a faster and lighter alternative to popular frameworks like Next.js or Remix. Astro seeks to combine the best of modern Ui frameworks with the simplicity, speed and durability of traditional static Html. And at the same time solve common problems with frameworks like Next.js or Remix.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was the initial objective of the project. And after that I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think that for the moment it can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

* As soon as the course continues, I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
